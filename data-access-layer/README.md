# Populating the database before running the API

1. Import the data from `$REPO_PARENT_DIRECTORY/capture-life-assessment/mongo-json-dump` into your MongoDB instance. There are (2) collections. One is for `posts` and the other is for `comments`. The UUIDs (`_ids`) are relied upon in the unit test's, and certain tests will fail if the data does not match what is expected. If you do not need to run the tests you may alternatively run `npm run seed` within the `$REPO_PARENT_DIRECTORY/capture-life-assessment/data-access-layer` NodeJS module and it will generate 25 comments and posts with unique ID's and then populate your MongoDB database instance with the new records.
