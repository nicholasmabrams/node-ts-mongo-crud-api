# Nicholas Abrams | Fullstack Developer Assessment for Capture Life 

##  Abstract
Thanks for the opportunity to prove my abilities using the technologies that I love, seperate myself from others in a tangible way, all while having fun!

## Requirements
* NodeJS 16.13.1 LTS runtime 
> Other modern versions should work too, however this project has only been tested using Node 16.13.1 LTS. 

> If you already have another version install, you may find it handy to use Node Version Manager to seemlessly manage switching to and from a variety of NodeJS and NPM versions.

* Download and install [Postman REST API tool](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

## Installation
> In your terminal or command prompt navigate into this projects root directory, install the NPM dependancies and then execute the NodeJS progam. 

1. Go into the projects top directory.

        %> cd $REPO_PARENT_DIRECTORY/capture-life-assessment

2. Install.

        %> npm i

3. Start the API server locally.
        
        %> npm run start

## Testing
> Unit tests and manual API testing is within the $REPO_PARENT_DIRECTORY/capture-life-assessment/unit-tests and  $REPO_PARENT_DIRECTORY/capture-life-assessment/manual-testing, respectively.

### Running unit tests 
    %> cd $REPO_PARENT_DIRECTORY/capture-life-assessment/unit-tests
    %> npm run test

### Validating functionality when manual testing the REST API

> Navigate to the $REPO_PARENT_DIRECTORY/capture-life-assessment/manual-testings within the context of the Postman API tool and open up the testing suite. You will now be able to choose the desired endpoint, appropriate HTTP verb as well as appropriate payload.
